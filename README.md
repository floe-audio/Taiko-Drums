# SCC Taiko Drums

This is a Floe-compatible version of S. Christian Collins' SCC Taiko Drums v1.0. It still works with SFZ players. This version is made by the Floe team and is not affiliated with S. Christian Collins or Subaqueous.

It's a free, community-created multisampled Japanese taiko drum sample library with multiple velocity layers and round-robin samples. A great starting point for taiko percussion in your projects. Each drum is triggered by a pair of adjacent keys (white + black) for easy drum rolls via trills. It's free to download and use. However, you must attribute the original authors of the samples if you share your music. Floe helps with this: https://floe.audio/usage/attribution.html

The samples are originally from [Subaqueous' Free Taiko Drum Rack](http://subaqueousmusic.com/free-taiko-drum-rack/), with additional samples from freesound.org. S. Christian Collins reprogrammed the samples with better velocity splits, natural velocity-to-attenuation scaling, and round-robin programming.

Modifications made:
- Added Floe Lua file with refactored drum mapping system
- Organized samples into a single playable instrument
- Converted to FLAC
